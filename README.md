# miniprojectFY
First Year python mini project - Amazon Web Scraper

This project was created in a team of three and we simply extracted data from html from www.amazon.in using python.

Libraries used for this project:
bs4
selenium
pandas

Make sure that you install the above libraries in your system before running the code.

# Project.
After executing the program, you are asked to enter a search query to search on www.amazon.in.

The program then opens a webdriver(google chrome in this case) and extracts information like description, price, and rating.

It then closes the driver and generates results.csv file containing the above information related to your search query.

It also displays the same in jupyter notebook itself, using pandas.
